# Why Models?

Why even bother at all with modelling?

## What do you get out of mechanistic modelling?

(in applied, non-academic, data-informed, infectious disease, public health work)

* Amplifies utility of data
* Forecasting (accessing 'data' of the future)
* Understanding mechanism (what caused the data we see?)

# Conclusions

* Modelling adds value to data
* Translating pandemic modeling experience into open-source software for future preparedness.
* The `macpan2` project is part of this effort.
* Sustaining incremental improvement is difficult but critical for epi-focused tools.
* Focus on model specification, simulation, and calibration.
* Training modellers on `macpan2` (Interested?)
