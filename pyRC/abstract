Epidemic Forecasting Software: Lessons from the COVID-19 Pandemic

The McMasterPandemic software was developed for COVID-19 forecasting. 

However, the urgency of producing regular forecasts impeded software development. 

To address these challenges, the macpan2 project was launched to create a more versatile public health modeling tool, integrating lessons learned from the pandemic: https://canmod.github.io/macpan2.

Instead of building models from the ground up, applied modellers can leverage macpan2's library of predefined models as starting points.

Additionally, macpan2 employs formal mathematical optimization for the efficient calibration of model parameters to data, even when these parameters evolve over time.

In this presentation, I will demonstrate macpan2's application with a variety of examples including COVID-19, Mpox, and Measles.  

I will conclude by comparing macpan2 with other tools like epiverse-trace and stan, highlighting the ongoing improvements and expansions in the set of open-source tools available for epidemiologists to build forecasting models.
