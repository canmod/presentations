# Why Refactor McMasterPandemic?

## Why Refactor? -- slow forecasting {.columns-2}

>- Confidence bands slow to compute
>- Based on repeated simulation
>- Most time-consuming step for PHAC
>- Two approaches:
>   - Translate to C++ (done)
>   - Parallelize (todo)

<p class="forceBreak"></p>

![](images/third_wave.png){width=90%}

## Why Refactor? -- slow calbration {.columns-2}

>- Calibration: tuning parameters to data
>- Example
>   - observed case reports -- dots
>   - simulated case reports -- line
>   - optimize transmission rate using maximum likelihood
>   - negative binomial error model

<p class="forceBreak"></p>

![](images/animation.gif)

## Why Refactor? -- slow calbration {.columns-2}

- Calibration: tuning parameters to data
- Based on trajectory matching
   - select parameter set
   - simulate data
   - compare simulated and observed data
   - update parameter set
   - repeat
- Again -- repeated simulations are slow

<p class="forceBreak"></p>

![](images/animation.gif)

## Why Refactor? -- slow scenario exploration {.columns-2}

>- Public health modeller has to make weekly forecasts
>- Model fitting/calibration takes two days
>- Only three days to 
>   - explore scenarios
>   - write the report
>- No time to refine the model
>- No time to refine messaging

<p class="forceBreak"></p>

- No time to refine messaging

**What if two days becomes two hours?**

**More time modelling and communicating, less time waiting for results**

![](images/foi-expand.png){width=70%}![](images/foi-where.png){width=50%}

## Why Refactor? -- slow model development {.columns-2}

>- New variant emerges, as immunity from vaccination wanes
>- Public health modeller has to create new model structure
>- Requires a few weeks of software development
>- Public health situation changes over this time
>- Model is less relevant when complete

# Architecture

## Architecture {.columns-2}

![](images/original_architecture.png){width=80%}

<p class="forceBreak"></p>

>- Call stack diagram
>   - Arrows from (layer of) functions that call other functions
>   - Arrows to (layer of) functions being called by other functions
>- Two use cases
>   - Calibration
>   - Forecasting
>- Both interfaces utilize same simulation engine

## Refactored Architecture {.columns-2}

![](images/original_architecture_define_simulate.png){width=80%}

<p class="forceBreak"></p>

>- Refactored components in grey
>- Focus on two things
>    - model definition conveniences (focused human time)
>    - simulation speed (human waiting time)

# Increasing Simulation Speed

## Technology Choice -- TMB

>- Template Model Builder -- TMB
>- R package (convenient)
>- Objective functions in C++ (fast)
>- Uses automatic differentiation (fast)
>- Options for statistical approaches

## Aside -- Automatic Differentiation

>- Classical methods of computer-assisted differentiation
>   - Numerical differentiation by finite differencing
>   - Symbolic differentiation by computer algebra systems
>   - These are both slow with many inputs
>- Automatic differentiation
>   - Automatically applies the chain rule to standard mathematical functions
>   - Will not give general answers (like symbolic differentiation)
>   - Give very fast and accurate evaluations of derivatives at specific values

## Benchmark Example {.build}

```
TMB: Time difference of 7.8s
R: Time difference of 1741.0s
Speedup: 224x
```

**But to be conservative we were seeing 60x speedups regularly**

**Does this mean that a workflow that took an hour, will now take one minute?**

**Not necessarily**

## Managing Expectations -- Theory {.build}

**Split up code into two sets:**

1. Refactored code
2. Not refactored code

**Simple but important insight:**

If the code that is not refactored takes $x$ minutes to run, the fastest run time that could be achieved by refactoring is $x$ minutes

## Managing Expectations -- Theory {.build}

**Two type of code that are in the "Not refactored" set**

>- The code in MacPan that is being executed by the user's job, but is not refactored
>- The code that the user wrote (**don't forget about this!**)

## Managing Expectations -- Theory {.build}

**Run-times of two sets of code, in different states**

* $r_{\text{before}}$: refactored code, before refactoring
* $r_{\text{not_done}}$: unrefactored code
* $r_{\text{after}}$: refactored code, after refactoring

The total run-time before refactoring:
$$
t_{\text{before}} = r_{\text{before}} + r_{\text{not_done}}
$$

The total run-time after refactoring:
$$
t_{\text{after}} = r_{\text{after}} + r_{\text{not_done}}
$$

## Managing Expectations -- Theory {.build}

Dimensionless measures of this system:

* Realized speedup: $\tau = \frac{t_\text{before}}{t_\text{after}}$
* Naive speedup: $\alpha = \frac{r_\text{before}}{r_\text{after}}$
* Fraction refactored: $\rho = \frac{r_\text{before}}{t_{\text{before}}}$

Expression for the realized speedups<footnote>This is [Amdahl's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law)</footnote>:
$$
\tau = \frac{1}{\frac{\rho}{\alpha} + 1 - \rho}
$$

## Managing Expectations -- Theory {.build}

* Conservative but typical realized speedups: $\tau \approx 6$
* Conservative but typical naive speedups: $\alpha \approx 60$

**Estimate fraction refactored, $\rho$, by rearranging Amdahl's Law**

$$
\rho = \frac{1 - \frac{1}{\tau}}{1 - \frac{1}{\alpha}} \approx 0.85
$$

## Performance Enhancements in Practice {.build}

>- Removing performance bottlenecks rarely results in speed ups
>- People try even more challenging computations
>- Measuring performance gains in units of 'times speed-up' misses the point
>- More of a binary thing:

**Has the performance optimization allowed people to do things that they couldn’t do before?**

## Testimonial

> I just wanted to send out this email to express how impressed/happy I am running the new TMB version.

> It is insanely fast and definitely saves me hours everyday and allows me to explore more scenarios.

> I can do many more things I couldn't before due to computation limitations.

> Thank you, you guys are heroes!

## Original McMasterPandemic Architecture {.columns-2}

![](images/original_architecture_define_model.png){width=80%}

<p class="forceBreak"></p>

>- Create any compartment topology
>- Fairly general specification of rates of flow among compartments

## Example -- SIR {.build}

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
state = c(S = 20000, I = 100, R = 0)
params = c(gamma = 0.06, beta = 0.15, N = sum(state))
```
```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
sir_model = (init_model(
    params, state,
    start_date = "2000-01-01",
    end_date = "2000-05-01",
  )
```
```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
  %>% add_rate("S", "I", ~ (1/N) * (beta) * (I))
  %>% add_rate("I", "R", ~ (gamma))
)
```{r echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
# Inflexible in both directions
# Both more and less complexity was difficult to add in McMasterPandemic
sir_model = (init_model(
    params, state,
    start_date = "2000-01-01",
    end_date = "2000-05-01",
  )
  %>% add_rate("S", "I", ~ (1/N) * (beta) * (I))
  %>% add_rate("I", "R", ~ (gamma))
)
```

## Example -- SIR

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
(sir_model
 %>% simulate
 %>% filter(variable %in% names(state))
 %>% rename(compartment = variable, state = value)
 %>% mutate(compartment = factor(compartment, names(sir_model$state)))
 %>% ggplot
  +  geom_line(aes(x = Date, y = state, colour = compartment))
)
```

## Example -- SIR

```{r echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
(sir_model
 %>% simulate
 %>% filter(variable %in% names(state))
 %>% rename(compartment = variable, state = value)
 %>% mutate(compartment = factor(compartment, names(sir_model$state)))
 %>% ggplot
  +  geom_line(aes(x = Date, y = state, colour = compartment))
)
```


## Example -- SIR

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
(sir_model
 %>% simulate(format = 'wide')
 %>% rename(`Force of Infection` = S_to_I)
 %>% ggplot
  +  geom_line(aes(x = Date, y = `Force of Infection`))
)
```

## Example -- SIR

```{r eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
(sir_model
 %>% simulate(format = 'wide')
 %>% rename(`Force of Infection` = S_to_I)
 %>% ggplot
  +  geom_line(aes(x = Date, y = `Force of Infection`))
)
```

## Example -- Matrix-Valued Rates {.build}

**Create symbolic vectors and matrices**

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
C = vec('Ca', 'Cp', '(Cm) * (1 - iso_m)', '(Cs) * (1 - iso_s)')
```

**Use vectors and matrices to define rates**

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
%>% add_rate("S", "E", sum(I * C * beta * inverse_N))
```

**Keep things compact even when the model gets complex**

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
%>% vec_rate(
  "S" %_% vax_cat,
  "E" %_% vax_cat,
  kronecker(vax_trans_red, t(baseline_trans_rates)) %*% Istate
)
```

## Example -- Erlang SEIR Model

## Example -- Erlang SEIR Model {.build}

```{r eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
m = 5 # number of E boxes
(chained_E_boxes = "E" %_% 1:m)
```

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# sojourn through exposed compartments
  %>% rep_rate(
    chained_E_boxes[1:(m-1)],
    chained_E_boxes[2:m],
    ~ (m) * (sigma)
  )
```
